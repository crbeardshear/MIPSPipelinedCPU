As far as we know, everything should work correctly. The registers and memory
were correct when tested.

As far as the circuit, it is laid out by phase. Signals which are valid for
the same phase are grouped together. Components which require signals from
multiple phases are placed where they are most used. The buffers between
phases are placed at the top.
